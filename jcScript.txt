Thanks. You from the United Nations? I'm ready, sir. Paul! I thought you were in Hong Kong. Didn't think you'd have a choice. What's going on? What are we waiting for? Looks like a textbook assault. All I've got with me is a pistol and an electric prod. I don't mind a test, but UNATCO better issue some hardware. I like to pick 'em off from a distance. I'll take the rifle. I get up the idea. What's the first move? Never know when I might come up against heavy armor. Give me the GEP gun. Great. What's the first move? The crossbow. Sometimes you've got to make a silent takedown. I get the idea. What's the first move? I'll see how it looks onshore. What are my orders when I reach the command center? You just going to stay here? Why'd they bring you back to New York? UNATCO pulled you out? Which Triad was UNATCO targeting? I want to hear what happened. I didn't know that. Guess I must be old news. A toast? That doesn't sound like our father. Strange how proud he could be when so much was due to our augmentations. I'm used to being on my own. What's your take on the situation, Corporal? How'd they get one of our agents? Right. How you guys holding up? I can't speak for command, but I'm gonna clean the place out. I do my best. Thanks. I won't let you down. We're taking a minimum-force approach. We're cops, after all. When due process fails us, we really do live in a world of terror. Guess so. Shouldn't you turn that stuff over to the quartermaster? I'll take the scope for 700. Here's 60 for the tranquilizer darts. 200 for 10 mm ammo sounds good. I'll check back with you later. I don't have the 700 for the scope. Some 10 mm ammo would be great, but I don't have 200. Even 60 credits for tranquilizer darts is more than I have. Iron and copper. The statue is copper on an iron frame, right? I heard that you can get me inside. You can trust me. Thanks. How do you know so much about the commander? UNATCO will probably keep him in custody. Don't forget that it was the NSF that C-4'ed the Statue in the first place. UNATCO's here to put the pieces back together. I can't promise. In the line of duty I may have to use force. I don't see anyone waving a white flag. We have an emergency here a terrorist offensive on U.N.-protected territory. Do you work for UNATCO or not? You holding out for more money? What's the deal? Don't forget that it was the NSF that C-4'ed the Statue in the first place. UNATCO's here to put the pieces back together. You with Filben? Tell me what you know about the NSF operation. A ship? I'll take the 10 mm clip for 175. Here's 300. Give me the 30.06 ammo. I'll give you 50 for the darts. 50 for the darts is a good deal, but I don't have it. No thanks. Glad you're not hurt, Agent. Risk is part of the job. I think you lucked out this time. As you wish. Take my pistol. First thing is to get you out of here. I'll handle the enemy. I just can't spare any arms. Please retreat to a safe location. So you think you know better than FEMA what to do with this month's Ambrosia shipment. Except send YOU back to the people in a body bag. Tell me about the shipment and I'll order the troops to pick you up as a prisoner instead of a corpse. Where are you taking it? You'll have to unload in New York because the choppers would spot you at sea. Just answer the question. Do you have a single fact to back that up? So? I guarantee you that the interrogation staff at UNATCO will not be as forbearing as I am. We will locate that shipment one way or another. That's a think-tank. Anyone can become a member. I found a back way into the Statue, but I'm sure UNATCO appreciates your dedication. You'll have to bring that up with Manderley. They crossed the line by going into the Statue. Shouldn't you turn that stuff over to the quartermaster? I'll check back with you later. I don't have the 700 for the scope. The leader surrendered. So they were after Ambrosia. I didn't know UNATCO handled the Ambrosia distribution. It's good to finally see some action. I don’t understand. He wasn’t cooperative. Alex said something about an Ambrosia shipment. So they just disappeared? We don’t know their location? My vision is augmented. Forgive my interruption. I just wanted so say that I look forward to working with you, Agent Navarre. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to be briefed by Mr Manderley. Could you tell me how to find Jaime’s office? I am prepared to perform my duties. No problem. Is Mr. Manderley available? Alex already told me thanks. Reporting for duty, sir. A refreshing change from the academy, sir. Clear, sir. So the NSF took a shipment of the Ambrosia vaccine? Give me a chopper and a pilot and I'll handle it. Yes, sir. No, sir. Friendly fire? You look like the real thing. They actually let you operate on people? I'm impressed. We'll have to catch up later. I've got to leave for New York right away. Could you send Manderley whatever it is he wants? As long as I don't turn green and grow a pair of antennas, as I understand it. Great. Have anything for me? I'll do that. It's about time they implemented some of this stuff. Haven't run into her. One more thing before I go, since you've been briefed on my augmentations. What can you tell me about the Infolink? Is there a way to turn it off? Yeah, or is someone at UNATCO tuned in 24 hours? Your clearance is higher than mine? No big deal. I was just curious. This thing is starting to give me a headache. I guess I'll get used to it. I suppose you already know who I am. Thanks. General Carter, I read about the Merced Operation in school. This is a great honor. I can't believe what the NSF did to your family. My parents died in a car accident. That's different. That sounds fine. Thank you, sir. Sorry, sir. I can't carry anything else right now. A "smart" lock pick is always handy. Can you spare a nanotech tech-tool? Just give me ammo. Hey what about that guy out front selling munitions? Is that allowed? Someone at UNATCO's a thief? What's that? Just tell me where it is. Thank you, sir. I'll check back with you later. Lead the way. Exterminate? What about the rest of the shipment? Are we going in the front, or is there another way? You don't look that bad. Tell me what you know about the NSF. Can you tell me anything specific? You don't look that bad. Tell me what you know about the NSF. All I have is a candy bar. Here you go. Do you have a place to stay? Speedboats? Is that how the NSF get their supplies? Interesting. Clever boy. It's the least I could do. Sorry, I don't have any food. I'm sorry. I can't kill you. Go to a public clinic; they can do something for the pain. You have the Gray Death? Here you go. Here you go. Sorry. UNATCO agent. How does a little boy get mixed up with the NSF? You can have this soy food. Glad I could help. Yeah? What kind of boxes? Thanks. Maybe I'll check that out. Sorry, I don't have any food. Sorry, kid. You mechs might have copper-wiring to re-route your fear of pain, but I've got nerves of steel. What it's like to stand around revving your actuators while the more advanced units complete the mission? No, thanks. Just give me the next objective. I can take out a booby trap. I'm learning as I go. I'm ready. Nothing we can't handle with a few EMP grenades. I can't carry anything else right now. Sir! I'm a UNATCO Agent. As soon as I open the train doors, I need you both to be ready to run on board. You all right? Why were the NSF holding the station? Were they transporting any heavy supplies? Barrels? Precious, indeed. They just gave up half a dozen lives for a couple of minutes. How's it look on the street? The fighting. Is it heavy? Hostages? Yeah. Thanks. What's the situation here? What about the EMP field? I'll question some of the locals. Maybe I'll start with the tavern. Why'd you have to clear the street? Maybe I'll do that. Just like the movies. Second floor, right? Whatever you say. I’m carrying too much equipment. Hold on while I make room. I’m ready. Not yet. We're looking for an illegal power generator in this area. Can you help me out? Sure. Do you remember the name of the street? That helps a little. Thanks. Forget it. Yes, I. What were they after? So those guys were NSF? So the terrorists are based in the subways? The sewers? Tell me how to find this base and I bet I can get the NSF off your back. Open up. I'm a federal agent. Just curious. Thought I heard you say Ambrosia. I'm sorry to hear that. I thought Ambrosia was an urban legend. I don't know what to say. You just have to do what you think is right. Can I ask a question? I'm looking around for a power generator, possibly hidden, large enough to power a building. I just need to find it. How do I get over there? Thanks for the tip. Tell me where you plan to get Ambrosia or I'll make sure you're arrested on conspiracy charges. So Ambrosia's been sold on the street. I'm serious. I want you to tell me what you know about the stolen Ambrosia. I heard "Ambrosia." You work here; you must know the area. Heard of an old warehouse with an illegal power generator? Where's that? I'd like to check it out. Sounds like a good place to start. That's some heavy augmentation. I'm in the business. A beer, please. I'll take a candy bar. How 'bout a soda? Mind if I ask you a few questions? Where's that? I don't have any liquor. You can have this bottle of liquor. You can have this beer. Thanks. Maybe I'll pay him a visit. You mean that guy Smuggler across the street? What's that? Actually, I'd rather hear whether you know anything about a warehouse with an illicit generator. You can have this beer. I'm sure plenty of bureaucrats fly out there. Not likely. A pilot? What do you fly? Surveillance is a very distributed technology. To centralize it in one large facility would be very unusual even for the U.N. Know anything that's worth the price of a beer? What kind of chopper pilot starts work at midnight? Why do you ask? I didn't know UNATCO hired pilots. What was Paul's assignment in Hong Kong? So he's holding something back the reason UNATCO transferred him back to the States. What's the problem? Slow down. Who's Johnny? Don't worry. I'll check it out. Sorry. Regulations prevent me from talking to the press. Like I said, I have nothing to say. I really can't be bothered right now. How about I ask you a few questions? Heard anything about a secret NSF power-generator? Just answer the question. On second thought, I don't need your help. I'd call it civil unrest. In a democracy, armed rebellion is criminal, not political. How much to take the lady off your hands for an hour? Deal. I gave you the money; now give me the girl. I want Sandra. Forget it. I'm not interested. Leave her alone or I'll have your ass picked up for pandering. You've got 10 seconds to beat it before I add you to the list of NSF casualties. Five seconds. Three. One. Sucks to get backed into a corner. Smuggler? Who's this "JoJo"? Warehouse? It looks like the fighting in the park has died down. The park? Where UNATCO has the NSF pinned down? Tell you what. I'll handle JoJo. You stay out of the way until the NSF have pulled back. You mentioned a smuggler. What's he sell? Weapons? Drugs? What? Sure, hand'em over. Keep'em. Those things save lives. I think your friend is going to be all right. He's on his back in the alley. I don't know, but if he gives you any more trouble just tell me. What can you tell me about his boss, JoJo? Maybe I'll cap his ass, too. Thanks. You've been very helpful. Don't you have someplace to go? I think I know your father. He runs the 'Ton, right? You could at least let your father know you're all right. You mad at him or something? He doesn't do such a bad job. I think you should be more grateful for what he's done. Let's leave it at that. Earlier, you said something about "the Smuggler". Bloodshot. Why the booby traps? Afraid of something? Against what? Is that so? A lab in the sewers? Maybe he was taken hostage by the NSF. Interesting. Maybe I'll take a look, but I think you should have a little more regard for the United States government. Tell me about the hardware. I'd offer 2100 for the scope, but I'm low on cash. How about you give me the bioelectric cell for 750? Too expensive. Maybe I'll try to locate your friend. Let's see the hardware again. If I had 3375, I'd make an offer on the Light Amplification Goggles. I'm not Bob Page, you know. Just going up to my brother's room. I'm your specialist. Just tell me where the hostages are being held. Carry on, Corporal. You better get out of here, Mr. Renton. We have a situation with the NSF outside. You better get out of here, Mr. Renton. Terrorists have taken cover inside the hotel. You'll be caught in the crossfire. I have to order you to leave the building. You all right, Mr Renton? Yeah. I think you’re gonna be okay. Yeah. How's you daughter? Is she somewhere safe? Tonight's a bad night on the streets. I'll take a look around. Sure. I'll check it out. By the way, I saw your daughter down the street. She didn't look so good. I took care of a thug who was harasing her, but she's still mixed up in some pretty nasty business. You better talk to her. I'll tell her she can trust you. UNATCO. Did you catch the name of the street? Anything interesting? That's very helpful. Thanks. Yeah. You can have your hotel back. My brother Paul's heading up the operation. The NSF won't have New York for long. There were a couple of NSF on the second floor. I took care of the situation. Doing fine. You guys can relax. Dead. But I played by the book: no deal with terrorists. I'll take a medkit. On second thought, hold on. I can't carry anything else now. I want the full program. Sure. No, thanks. Never mind. Excuse me? Hi, I'm in charge of law enforcement on this block. You doing all right? Perfectly fine. Just making sure everyone's safe. You know what they're doing in this neighborhood? Maybe I'll look into it. You take care of yourself. You have the plague? You live in a tunnel? Where's that window you were talking about? You should be more appreciative. By helping you, this gentleman risks his own health. Don't mention it. Never mind. He said leave. Don't make me use force. The doc said you're done. Now move out. You must be Ford Schick. Smuggler sent me. Who's holding you here? I don't recognize the uniforms of the soldiers. Corporate security isn't usually outfitted to fight a ground-war. Wait here while I deal with security. Make a break for it. I'll protect you. Tell me what’s going on here. What’s this facility for? Who kidnapped you? I don’t recognize the uniforms of the soldiers. They’re pretty well-armed for corporate security. Wait here while I deal with security. Make a break for it. I’ll protect you. I got your friend out. Fine. You were right about those troops. Definitely not NSF. I wouldn't go that far. You said you'd make it worth my while? Why the booby traps? Afraid of something? I got your friend out of the underground lab. He’s doing fine. Who were those troops? They didn’t look like NSF. You in the black market? Is that why they call you Smuggler? Depends on what you have. Why the booby traps? Afraid of something? Against what? Is that so? The sewers. Yeah, I found your friend. They had him doing research. I tried to break him out, but he died. I’m sorry. I wish I had better news. I'll take the scope for 700. Here's 250 for the bioelectric cell. 1125 for Light Amplification Goggles? Sure. See you later. No problem. Not interested. No problem. I took care of the generator. How's the raid going? Did something go wrong? Hey, you're the guy I talked to at the Underworld Bar, right? The one asking for beer. Hold on. Let's go. Hold on. Let's go. Yeah? Simons. You guys from D.C.? What agency? Looks pretty bad down there. The NSF aren't kidding around. How are you holding up? You've got a lot on your hands. Don't beat yourself up over faulty equipment. Well, get well soon, soldier. Mr Carter, I can't tell you how great it is to be a part of UNATCO. You should have seen the fighting in Castle Clinton. I cleaned the place out. I never thought I'd see this much action in one mission. I was told to report for a debriefing. Agent Denton, at your service. Doing my best, sir. Forgive me, but I do not believe I know your name. Thank you, sir. Who was that you were meeting with? I would have taken out that JoJo punk, but he wasn't in the warehouse. What about the shipment? What went wrong? I can't believe that. Paul's a good agent. Has it been located? Where should I start? I'll check out the subways. Yes, sir. You with the NSF? Well you take care of yourself. Sounds like you served God admirably in the Northwest War. But maybe you should let a soldier from the younger generation take the clips off your hands. What do you want for them? I'll check back with you later. I'll take both of them for 600. I can think of safer places to camp, after all the fighting tonight. Why the name "mole people"? Maybe you should join your people. Anywhere underground would be safer than Battery Park. The NSF are hiding out with the mole people? I need to contact the NSF. Think you could tell me how to find the moles? It's a matter of national security. It's imperative that I find the NSF hideout. xyzzy. Anonymous. Just tell me how to find the NSF. Underworld. Thanks. Thanks again for the key. Sorry I didn't need your help on the island. I hope it wasn't a wasted trip. A real patriot. The goal of UNATCO is not conquest. It's the safety of ordinary people like yourself. I'm not interested. Sure. 500 for where I can find the code to the phone booth. I think I talked to the guy. He said the NSF were hiding out with the moles. Are they allies? Aiding and sympathizing, just as bad as being a terrorist yourself, in my opinion. I already got the code to the phone booth, but thanks. We think they're loading the Ambrosia onto a plane. Heard anything about that? Lebedev? Since when is LaGuardia for sale? Who does he buy off? Who? I'm looking for the mole people. I don't need a place to camp. How do I find them? I hear the NSF are using the mole people hideout as a base. I work for UNATCO. Tough break. You tell me about the NSF, and I'll put in a word with the city about the water. I don't have much time. Clearing a tunnel, that would require explosives. You have a problem? A bomb's a bad choice for close-range combat. What kind of bomb? You looking to trade? No zyme. Sorry. Suppose I could part with a vial of zyme, if you'll give me the LAM. Yeah. Let's see the LAM. Make it last. I killed homeboy out by the tracks. Hope it lasts. Tough luck. The water lines should be open now. Now can you tell me about the NSF? How do I get there? Great. I'm glad I could help you out. What is it? You call yourselves Rooks? I'll keep that in mind. Yeah? Who says? Just give me the LAM, punk. Some gangbanger. Maybe you should think about going back to school. I want more. Either your life is worth more than a LAM, or it's not worth living. Charlie says you sell explosives. I'm from out of town. I hear the NSF are operating around here somewhere. Know anything about it? How much? How much? Pretty steep for second-hand goods. Already dead. Just another parasite. I already dealt with that guy. Knocked him unconscious, flat on his back. I used as much force as the situation required. You trying to lecture me on tactics? I'll think about it. Don't have any zyme. I said you're out of luck. I'll take a vial of zyme. What do you know about a gang called the rooks? Just what I heard. Seems that other people aren't so lucky. The junkies? Know where I can find the mole people? You want to set a price? I'm with UNATCO. Start talking. Let's try some word-association. First word: Ambrosia. Maybe later. Take a vial. Now maybe you can calm down for a second and tell me how to get to the mole-people hideout. And? The code? Yeah? I give up. What boxes? Yeah, well I'd stay away from that room for awhile. It's not too pretty in there. I believe you. I was just over there myself. Looks like you've been overrun by NSF. Anything recently? Where were they headed? Some of the terrorists actually live down here? I'll have a talk with him. You won't have to worry about the NSF for much longer. I met him already. He was somewhat cooperative but I had to take him down. I don't think you'll have to worry about the NSF for a while. We've met already. He's an accountant or something. I don't think he'll give you any trouble. The mole people say the Ambrosia came through here an hour ago. This better not be a joke. Your "militia" killed a lot of our men tonight. You work for the NSF? You got that right. UNATCO will have a team here in a few minutes. You believe that? You better step away from the jet. Your boss is my next objective. Blackmail of the U.S. government could not possibly escape the notice of the United Nations. Are you kidding? The UN's about the only chance we've got these days. If the US spirals into another Civil War. Is that so? How do you know anything about the Feds? Here's 400 for the recoil weapon mod. Gotta get rid of some gear. Hold on. I'll take the shotgun shells for 300. Maybe later. My pleasure. What? We're assuming control of the airfield. The vaccine will be returned to the international authorities. He makes his own decisions. He surrendered. He's an unarmed prisoner UNATCO policy protects him. If you know something, just tell me. UNATCO has briefed me on my augmentations. Get to the point. That's a pretty big claim. Sounds like a picture-perfect description of the NSF. The supply is limited. That doesn't mean there's a conspiracy. Go on. Why tell me all this? All right. We're alone. If you have proof of a conspiracy, let's hear it. UNATCO has briefed me on my augmentations. Get to the point. That's a pretty big claim. Your proof? You expect me to believe there's a group of people powerful enough to control the United Nations? Standard procedure, it appears. I'm sure we can count on you. Yeah, well. There was shooting on the 747. I didn't see what happened. Maybe Anna beat you to it. Some bad news. I already took him out. Some bad news. Agent Navarre beat you to it. Hey, about my brother. Don't you think we should give Paul a chance to explain himself? He's been with UNATCO for years. It's true. Paul's been working for the NSF. The Coalition will recover. I'm not so worried about the Coalition. Give me a minute to look around. I'm ready. Let's move out. I guess he got a better offer. I don't understand it myself, but we've got to go on. Is Manderley available? I'll let him know. Objectives complete, sir. I only wish to serve the Coalition to the best of my ability. Yes, sir. Activated, what? Can they really kill him with the press of a button? What about Paul? Will I get to see him again? Yes. I have some bad news about Agent Navarre. Lebedev. A surprise attack. Yes, sir. I'm not covering up Paul, sir. Activated, what? I think I've proved myself. Can they really kill him by pressing a button? What about Paul? Will I get to see him again? Yes. Sorry about not killing Lebedev. He seemed worth interrogating. I guess that means I don't get the op bonus? I risked my life, and I recovered the Ambrosia. I deserve compensation. I try to do the best job I can. Yes, but. Activated, what? Can they really kill him with the press of a button? What about Paul? Will I get to see him again? Yes. Well, I took out his boss. I hope that changes his mind. Agent Navarre was out-of-line. I had no choice. Neither did I. He sure caused his share of trouble. I don't know what to think anymore. He got me to disobey orders. I don't know what to think anymore. He thinks he has proof of a conspiracy. You think he's right? Fine. I completed the mission objectives. Not if you pause for a second and think about who he was and what he stood for. Every war is the result of a difference of opinion. Maybe the biggest questions can only be answered by the greatest of conflicts. Not so good. I don't know who to trust anymore. Manderley certainly does. Right. I'll take tranquilizer darts for the crossbow. I've been using a shotgun. Sniper rifle, thirty-ought-six. A GEP rocket. Get everybody patched up? Never felt better. Yes, sir. I'm grateful for that. I just wish we'd found out sooner. Is a few liters going to be enough? Paul said UNATCO uses the Ambrosia supply to influence national governments. What do you think about that? Yeah, he tried to recruit me. I waxed his boss. Maybe he'll get the message. He makes some sense. I spared his boss, Juan Lebedev. He makes some sense. I ignored the mission objective of killing his boss, Juan Lebedev, but Agent Navarre intervened. He boxed my ears. No big deal. He gave me one more chance. I'm on my way to Hong Kong. I didn't talk to him yet. Don't you work down in Washington? Sounds like you wouldn't have much use for physical augmentations. But you're the director. You work behind a desk. What do you mean by "overhaul"? UNATCO was very effective this evening. We recaptured the shipment. Like who? Excuse my persistence. I'll wait for the memo. My orders are to go to Hong Kong. What's wrong? I'm not going after anybody. JoJo Fine of the NSF? You can forget about JoJo. I left him on his back in the hotel. He's not going to be a problem anymore. You better stay here until the police say it's okay. Anything for sale? So you heard that he went over to the NSF. Maybe I should prepare for the worst. What do you have for me? Not interested. Like I said before, I don't talk to the press. What I want to know is how my boss found out I talked to you. I think one of us told him. I wish I had an answer to that, but even if I did it wouldn't be any of your business. How about I interview you? Tell me what you've dug up on the raid. I'm the one asking questions. All right, forget it. I'll find out on my own. Yeah? UNATCO's looking for him. He worked for the NSF. I already took care of that punk JoJo, if that's what you mean. Surprised? A bottle of booze, please. I'm not involved with any kind of raid. Thanks for the advice. Tell me about this raid. Who are they after? It was good talking to you. Nothing, but thanks. Is this killswitch real? What's it going to do to you? Manderley said you're going to die. There's a chopper that can take us to Hong Kong. You know Jock? I came to get you out of here. You've done what you can for the rebels. Let's go. Go on. I'm prepared to believe you. I killed Agent Navarre, and I'll join you against UNATCO but I want proof. And I suppose while I'm there you want me to encrypt a signal with the NSF transmitter, bypass UNATCO SigInt? I'll check out the facility, but I can't promise I'll help the terrorists. Be ready to leave for Hong Kong when I get back. You sure you're all right? That they have this kind of power. You think they knew? They would never have agreed to anything like a killswitch. What's the trouble? I can straighten him out. Just tell me where he is. He's just a punk. I'll take care of it. You can have my pistol. Be careful with that. I would rather not arm a civilian. Besides, it's against the law for civilians to carry weapons. I was hoping I'd run into that punk. I think you'll be happier without that guy around. Who the hell are you? I live here. This hotel belongs to the Renton family. Had to pack a few things. What's going on here? Probably had something to do with my two-faced brother. Mind if I take a look around? Your buddy Chad should have received the signal. Come one. UNATCO's after both of us. I have a question about Simons. The instant I sent the signals, he ordered the troopers to hunt us down. Why does FEMA have authority over UNATCO? I thought FEMA was a domestic agency for flood relief and that sort of thing. Come on. Out the window. We'll meet Jock in Battery Park. I just can't leave you here. Loyalty to what Simons and agent like you have made of UNATCO. I would rather die. Another peacekeeping occupation? I surrender. Here comes your chance to be a hero. You're early. I've got at least twenty hours left. I don't feel anything. What have you done with Paul? I never worked for the NSF, but my brother did. I think he was captured, too. Are you sure? It can't be. Good. Maybe I can find him. Yeah, I'll take the medkit. Sure, come on. Stay close. I'd rather that you wait here. Just slip out. I'll handle the guards. Yeah. How do you know who I am? My brother? Is he nearby? Did you know Paul? Do you know Paul? Do me a favor, play dumb. They know enough already. Maybe you can slip out when I open the main doors. I would. Thank you very much. Paul! Are you all right? What are they doing to you? I hate to interfere with science, but we don't have much time to get you to Tracer Tong. You sure? All right. But you better make it. By the way, be on the lookout for Anna. She came by the cellblock. Interesting. I guess mechs have us beat on one count. Thanks for the tip. Trouble with the bots? Maybe somebody hacked the security system and tinkered with its programming. I know a thing or two about bots. Why don't you give me the security login, and I'll see what I can do. So? You gonna sound the alarm? Here's 500. Tell me the security login. Thanks. Sounds like fun. Give me the accuracy weapon mod for 750. I'll take the 762 ammo for 600. 762 ammo for 600, a little beyond by means right now. Wait a minute. I'm pretty loaded down. Let me drop something. I forgot to give Manderley my resignation. Yeah. MiB's raided the apartment. MIB's raided the apartment, but he's alive. He's going to slip out on his own. I'm going over to the resistance. Why don't you join me? We could meet up in Hong Kong. We're both going to have to locate a man called Tracer Tong, Paul's contact there. Jaime, be careful. Stay here. I could use an ally inside UNATCO. Do that, but be careful. You know what they do to spies. The one on the counter? Can your bots do the installation? Guess it will have to be a retirement gift. Thanks for tuning in. I'll take care of Anna. I'll see what I can do. Take your best shot. Take your best shot, Flatlander woman. Thanks Daedalus. Hello Daedalus. I hope my escape was entertaining to watch. I think you've already stuck out your neck Daedalus. You haven't been contacting me under an alias? Who else has access? Somebody cut the power to Detention. Not as much as you're scaring me. Who's Daedalus, and why does he want to rescue me? You wouldn't want to take that chance. You sound sincere. Maybe you should quit UNATCO. You can track me down in Hong Kong. I'm going to contact Tracer Tong and help the resistance. Carry on with your banking. I'm just taking one last look at the old place. Amazing, if you think about it, all the hours I spent dreaming about working here, all the heroic fantasies, when really this place is just a cinderblock bunker with a carpet. Something wrong? Really, as long as you stay out of the way, I don't have any reason to hurt you. I'm the last person who's gonna bust you for stealing. What'd you take? 1250 for a scrambler grenade? I don't even have enough for one. Give me one of the scrambler grenades for 1250. Remember, hush-hush. I'll take two for 2500. I'll give you 3750 for all three. I'll pass. General Carter. I've discovered some things about UNATCO. Walton Simons, the head of FEMA. I'm going over to the rebels. You should join me. What good's an honest soldier if he can be ordered to behave like a terrorist? By the way, I found out who around here is the thief. I never had time to take the Oath of Service to the Coalition. How about this one? I swear not to rest until UNATCO is free of you and the other crooked bureaucrats who have perverted its mission. We'll see about that. Figured he was your type, a real hard-ass. Well, since that makes you my new boss, take a long look at Manderley's dead body. Consider that my resignation; I don't have time to write a letter. We'll see about that. How'd you know to meet me? A friend of yours? I wish he was coming with us. Can you put me in contact with Tracer Tong? Great. Let's go. What do you think of the Luminous Path Triad? What kind of weapons? How do you invent a sword? What do you think of the Red Arrow Triad? You sound certain. Have you heard of Maggie Chow? Can I ask you something? Despite all I've read about the Triads, I wasn't prepared to see them operating in the open, on the streets, and wearing uniforms. Doesn't the Chinese government care? I would think the secret smuggling operations of the Triads would disturb the Chinese government. You said "outside influences." What does China fear? As long as they don't break the law. Our governments have limited power by design. I give up. Hardly as sinister as a dictator, like China's Premier. The separation of powers acknowledges the petty ambitions of individuals; that's its strength. Perhaps certain qualities are an inseparable part of human nature. I'll get a drink later. Guess I stumbled into the main office. One of you guys run the place? You're Max Chen, right? You're the boss here? I'm looking for Tracer Tong. It is urgent that I find him. I don't understand. What? My name is JC Denton. I have something to tell you. Maggie Chow isn't who you think she is. She's an operative for a group called Majestic 12. She stole the Dragon's Tooth and killed your predecessor. I read it in a police file at the Wan Chai station. It makes sense! She's trying to provoke a war. My brother's name is Paul Denton. I heard that he was a frequent visitor to this compound. Do you know him? Paul was no friend of the West. Paul is no friend of the West. I was before Paul showed up in New York. A day later I was helping the NSF. I don't have time for games. I know who she is. She works for Majestic 12, and she did steal the sword. I read it in her file at the police station. Why is one sword so important? I'll go speak to her. But first I need to find a man called Tracer Tong. I need his help. I'll help you against Ms. Chow, but then I'll need to see Tong, or I won't be your ally for more than 12 hours. She is the one responsible for the missing sword. She works for Majestic 12. A group of conspirators who want to take control of Hong Kong. Yes, I found the sword in her apartment. Where do I find this "dragon head"? Slow night? Why'd they do that? That must hurt the shops in Wan Chai. Must be the Year of the Vulture. I'll take the accuracy mod for 750. Wait, I've got to drop something first. 600 for a reload mod, deal. Here's 400 for a recoil mod. Maybe later. I don't even have 400 for the recoil mod. Not much activity down here. Anything. The canal's dead. You mean heroin. You saw the body? It was what? What else do you find? Do you sell it? Just curious. I hear the Triads control all of the smuggling in Hong Kong. By sampan? But you said. Right. I will have to stop by and take a look sometime. Warn me about what? Paul's my brother. What's the problem? You can trust me. I really am Paul's brother. You said something about blueprints. VersaLife. Good, we're getting closer. You might as well tell me the rest. If I'm gonna kill you, you're already dead. What did Paul want with VersaLife? Give me the VersaLife blueprints for 2000. 4,000 for thermoptic camo wish I had the cash. I'll take the scrambler grenade for 1250. 4,000 for thermoptic camo deal. I'll check back with you. Heard the name Tracer Tong? What's his reputation among the locals? Just curious. Is there a lot of crime in Hong Kong? What kind of smugglers? Is there really a slave-trade? What sort of biotech smuggling goes on? Why would a multinational corporation smuggle their products on sampans? On what? What's VersaLife trying to develop? The Second Men? Afraid not. I'm not big into books. Do you know of a Maggie Chow? Who does she spy for? Something to drink. Whatever you’ve got to eat. Oops. No room. Let me lighten my load. What can you tell me about traffic on the canals? Yeah? You have me confused with someone else. Really, I. What business is it of yours? I'm here on business with Gordon Quick. Thank you. Maggie Chow wants to see me. I assume that's her hotel across the street. How do I get up to see her? Excuse me. Do you know a man named Tracer Tong? I'm sorry. I don't understand. I'm looking for a way into this building. Good advice. Yeah, well, tell her I know she double-crossed the Red Arrow, and I intend to prove it. She should never have sent me to the police station. Now I know she is hiding something, and I intend to find out what it is. I'm looking for Maggie Chow. Sorry to bother you. I was looking for a man named Tracer Tong. You know who I am. And Paul? You know my brother? Paul never mentioned you. But why? Can you help me find a man named Tracer Tong? I don't understand. Just the name. And he double-crossed them? What does Majestic 12 want with the Red Arrow? The Dragon's Tooth, right? What kind of sword? So Majestic 12, they're trying to tip the balance? Give the Luminous Path a technological advantage? It's only fair to tell you that I spoke with Gordon Quick before coming here. I thought he was a friend of my brother's. I agreed to visit you and learn the truth of the situation. Who are the Luminous Path, anyway? The market? I came from there just now; I must have missed the place. There's something I have to tell you about Paul. Miss Chow, Maggie, Paul is dead. UNATCO agents killed him. I'm sorry. I understand how you must feel. You all right? Yes, he was. I know, the danger. Paul's on his way to Hong Kong. I don't know when he will arrive. I can look around, try to learn something about the Luminous Path. What for? A forgotten virtue like honesty is worth at least twenty credits. It was nothing. Why? You know something? Thanks for the tip. You're this far into withdrawal; maybe it's time you kick the habit. It's for your own good. What do you think of the Triads? They give you a lot of trouble? How do you know that the sword came from VersaLife? What do you know about Maggie Chow? What about now? She probably has a lot of money to invest. The States. Hm. On vacation? JC. Is this a good club? Sure. How much do you need? Sorry. Sure. No problem, we go way back. Wanna dance? There's only one way to find out. Anything you want. How about that dance? Sorry. You'll have to fend for yourself. I got you in. I'm not paying for anything else. Here you go. I just want to ask a few questions. What kind of job? Tough luck. What's a Quick Stop cashier doing working for the Red Arrow? Sorry to bother you. Hello there. Do you know a man named Max Chen? Do you know where I can find him? I'll tell you later. Great place here! In what way? Sure. I already have a date, thanks. Where can I find Max Chen? No thanks. Mind if I ask what you were talking about? It just sounded interesting. Troops at a corporation? I'm looking for Max Chen. I need to find Tracer Tong. Maggie Chow sent me. Just curious, I guess. I'll take a drink. Gimme a forty. Ooops. Forgot how much I was carrying. Hold on while I get rid of something. You must be Max Chen. I found something in Miss Chow's apartment that might interest you. The sword was never destroyed. It was stolen, and she is the one who stole it. I have it right here. She works for a group called Majestic 12. She's using you and the Red Arrow for her own ends. Think about it. She murders your predecessor, hides the sword, pushes the Red Arrow into a war with the Luminous Path, and then? What next? The Triads are weakened, and an outside group seizes power. Sound far-fetched? Perhaps you should meet with the leaders of the Luminous Path. MJ12 troops. They must have followed me. You were right. Maggie Chow is a con artist. Yes, I found the sword in her apartment. I've already been to the Lucky Money. Max Chen has declared a truce between the Red Arrow and the Luminous Path. I informed Chen about the sword. He's declared a truce between the Red Arrow and the Luminous Path. Majestic 12 attacked the club. I think he would consider forming an alliance. Mr. Tong. You knew my brother, Paul Denton. Mr Tong. You know my brother, Paul Denton. I feel fine, but it's been over 16 hours. Can you do something about it? In other words, I'll owe you a favor. I assume he checked out. That's it? Have you heard about Paul? I plan to make sure he didn't die for nothing. Have you heard from Paul? Quick and Chen declared a truce just a few minutes ago. I think they will be slow to anger with Maggie Chow out of the picture. So that's all you expect me in the way of a favor? A little corporate espionage? Hundley. I'll find the ROM-encoding, but I'm not your henchman. I'll help you as long as we have a mutual interest. You took a big risk following me here. Thanks. How'd you find Tong so quickly? Any news from Jaime? Yeah, me too. Did you ever dig up anything about this Daedalus character? I'm still hearing from him. Supposedly? So what happened? So the thing that's talking in my head is what? A resurrected AI? I'm looking for Mr Hundley. Thank you. I'm contracting this month. Quite a facility you have here. Any chance I could get a tour of the labs? I'll make it worth your while. Sure. Thanks. 2000 sounds reasonable, but I don't have the cash on me. Never mind. The schedule. Yeah, sure. They'll understand. Special agents? Just looking around. They keep you up here pretty late. Why not? They probably don't want you telling people that. Why would they do that? I got access to the labs from the shift supervisor. I'll check them out and let you know what I find. Guy in a suit? He's dead. You don't have to worry about him anymore. Part of an intelligence operation. I'd really like to check out those labs. Does it matter? What's that? I want to see those labs. I already killed him. The guy in the suit, right? I took him out. Part of an intelligence operation. You have time to get clear. But I need clearance, okay? All right. I killed your boss. He's out of the picture. I'd advise you not to hang around too long. Now how about getting me into the labs. Yeah that's me. I've looked forward to this for a long time. Yes, sir. I'll try not to get in anyone's way. I was down in the labs. Do you know what they're doing? Take my advice and get out of here. I can't tell you any more than that. It is my honor. Thanks for the offer. Maybe I'll stop by. Have you heard? The Triads have united. Go to Wan Chai. Ask the people. The Red Arrows have thrown off the outside agents that were using them against the Chinese government. No one uses them anymore. And now they are one society. Think the truce will improve business? Are they really that hard on shop owners? Peace between the Triads is now official. What next? VersaLife was crawling with troops. I think they were hiding more than sword technology down there. Plenty of scientists, biotech, physics, nanotech, several research divisions. It would seem we still have a mutual interest. Do you think you could find a cure? I'll go back, but won't they be ready for me? Worth a try. Maybe I'll check it out. You should never have sent me to the police station. What did you expect, that they would arrest me? Turns our you're on your way to being one of Hong Kong's most wanted yourself. How's that? Excuse me. I was looking for a way back to the market. I was swimming. Is there a way back to the market from here? Just browsing. What do you think of the Triad situation? No? So it was Maggie Chow who stole the sword. I saw it with my own eyes. I believe Maggie Chow was killed. Yeah. You? You cut it pretty close. Will you get better? Any permanent damage? Just getting to know the locals. Turns out VersaLife had a Universal Constructor; they were synthesizing the virus right here. Majestic 12 sure does a lot of R & D. I'm going to see what Tong has to say about the schematics I recovered. Hey, do me a favor. Get better. Don't know if I care for your sense of humor. The Illuminati stuff. I was risking my life in there. Like Stanton Dowd? What do they have to do with Majestic 12? What about a hacker named Daedalus? A superfreighter. That's enough virus to infect a continent. Tell your people not to tangle with him. I'll deal with him myself. Do you have what you need to synthesize a cure? I also destroyed the Universal Constructor they were using to manufacture the virus. but I did it on the advice of the hacker, Daedalus. Who is he, really? Alex says he may be an AI, part of an old government program. But who? I don't like mysteries either. Looks like we all made it. Maybe so. I'm glad that you're safe. You didn't have to take that kind of risk. Isn't that sensitive technology? Hold on while I drop some gear, then I'll take it off your hands. Well, thanks. Now hang tight for a while. UNATCO will be looking for you. Yeah. You know him? I guess we'll find out when we get to New York. Let's not waste any time. I didn't expect the Kitchen to be under martial law. You still on the dole at UNATCO? Right, the Illuminati. I need to find one of their leaders, Stanton Dowd. A load of plague virus is on its way to New York. The same corporation that makes Ambrosia also manufactures the virus. Quite convenient. The virus came over in a superfreighter previously owned by Dowd. I was hoping Dowd could tell me where the freighter would unload. Osgood and Sons. The reporter? Are you sure? Already took care of him. I don't like people who ask a lot of questions. Hi, Sandra. Too bad about the hotel. I guess UNATCO shot it up pretty bad. They aren't the only ones. Yeah? What did he look like? Know the Marine at the bar? Is that Marine really a friend of yours? Think I can trust him? Thanks. Heard the name Stanton Dowd? A private matter. Know where I can find him? Gunther. Give me something to drink. I'll have one of those candy bars. Never mind. You out here because of martial law? I didn't know they were using Marines. She left town. What's FEMA doing handing out travel papers? They brought in their own staff? I would, too. Maybe I'll check it out for you. Used to be. Thanks. I'll see what I can find out. I'm sure FEMA has a good reason for the tight security. There's talk that you're a spy. I just want to hear your side of the story. You tell me. I'll take that as a denial. Something newsworthy about the clinic tonight? Maybe they think you're talking about the food of the gods. Could be. Hey, you're a reporter. Heard the name Stanton Dowd? I just need to find him. Do you know him or not? Could be. Don't believe everything you read. You aren't a reporter at all. You work for UNATCO. You Dowd? Why a vacant building? I thought the Illuminati were bankers, politicians. You all right? It's accurate. I just don't know where the freighter would dock. Of course. That's why FEMA took it over. Scuttle a superfreighter? I already have some explosives. You sure you're all right? Don't worry; I'll get you some medicine. Bloodshot. Unfinished business. I don't know if I've joined anything, except maybe the people. I've got to get moving. Have anything you want to sell? If I had 7500, I'd make an offer on the assault shotgun. How about some Sabot rounds for 750. I'll take the five LAMs for 3500, when I get the cash. Never mind. I’ll give you 7500 for the assault shotgun. I’ll take the five LAMs for 3500. Anything you say. I need your help. I've located a supply of the virus that causes Gray Death. A freighter at the Brooklyn Naval Shipyard. Conspirators, some in the government, some out. Help me scuttle it. You have any extra LAMs or rockets? A few LAMs, at weld points. 2500 for GEP ammo sounds great, but I don't have that much. Wish I had a 2400 credits. I could use a half-dozen LAMs. Give me a break. Hundreds of millions of lives are at stake. Forget it. Relax. No one followed me. You have nothing to worry about. Actually, UNATCO's planning an operation of some kind. You might want to get out of Hell's Kitchen after I leave. A manhunt. For me. I don't think you want to get caught in the middle. A Marine from the shipyard told me that FEMA's involved. Guess they've gone from fixing emergencies to making them. I think we can expect Walton Simons to make a grab for power, one way or another. I took out that reporter, Joe Greene. I don't like people who ask a lot of questions. I'm ready! Hold on. I'll be back in a minute. I'll raid the armory at the shipyard. Let's go. Wait here. I'll be right back. Who's asking? Is FEMA really running the show? Me either. Yeah. Mind if I take a look at the ship? I'll stay out of the way. I'm late. Let me pass. Yeah? Me too. I will. Thanks. I won't get in the way. Sounds like a job for bots. I could take a look for you. I'm here to meet with Dowd. The gatekeeper. How else? I took him out before he could say much. Better safe than sorry. I have some good news. I scuttled the freighter and destroyed the stockpile of virus. Not really. Think I should check it out? He seemed harmless. Anyway, I scuttled the freighter and destroyed the stockpile of plague virus. I brought you something for that cough. Hope it works. You sound pretty bad. I'm sorry, but I didn't manage to retrieve any Ambrosia. Mr. Dowd, tell me something. Someone calling himself Daedalus has been broadcasting to my infolink. He wants me to go to Paris to find an associate of yours, Morgan Everett. I don't know. He seems to be an ally. But if your friend doesn't want to be found. He developed the virus for the Illuminati? Page, the billionaire. How does he relate to Majestic 12? So Everett should be able to reverse-engineer Page's modifications and help find a cure. Daedalus said I should find Nicolette DuClare first. How do I find Nicolette? Great. I'll have Jock drop me off near the catacombs. Thanks. I'm sure they will be helpful. Ready to head out? Dowd needs us to contact his associate in Paris. Wait here while I look around. Let's go. What's wrong? Stop who? Contamination and mutants, where? Sorry to hear that. I took care of the greasels. Nothing can bring back their victims, but rest assured: the threat is gone. Rockets? Bravery is not a function of firepower. Who's this? Everything, huh? Is that God you're talking about or just a bunch of New Age crap? Yeah? Those prices sound pretty steep. You mean the military guys in the metro station? I took care of them. Turns out I'm not a friend of the current regime. Maybe I can help you out. Pretty steep prices. I'll think about doing that favor. Heard of a resistance group called Silhouette? I need to contact them. I've been told they have a hideout in the catacombs. Yeah? Is Silhouette's bunker concealed? 5250 for the rockets. Sounds good. How about the recoil suppressor for 1200. How about that. I believe the UNATCO people will use the term harmonic stabilizer. 6750 for three LAMs would be reasonable, if I had the cash. The crackdown must hurt business. I'm working against the group that controls the French government. I want to help Silhouette. Tell me how to find the secret bunker. The troops you've seen aren't French. They belong to an international group called Majestic 12. Pretty steep prices. I'll think about doing that favor. I took out the troops in the station. They're dead. Now what about giving me a deal on some hardware. I'll take the three LAMs for 2250. I think I understand. I came to help. Where? I'm on my way to see Chad right now. Maybe I can change his mind. I'm on my way to find her right now. Me too. I'm JC Denton. You might know my brother Paul. I helped him send your group a warning about the crackdown. Pretty much a skeleton crew you have here. How long can your people hold off MJ12? Where? Maybe I can help you out, in exchange for a small favor. I need to find Nicolette DuClare. I need to contact some friends of her mother's. You have a right to be cautious. Just point me to Bunker 03. Sorry, just looking around. Aren't you afraid of the commandos? Right. You tell them that. Maybe later. I'll take a medkit for 600. On second thought, forget it. I can't carry that right now. I freed the hostages. Both of them made it to the hideout safely. I made sure of it. I have some bad news. Neither of them made it back alive. I'm deeply sorry. I wish there was something more I could do. I freed the hostages. I'm afraid only one made it back. I saved as many as I could. They only had two of your people; one didn't make it. I did my best. I freed the hostages. Trust me; your people will be all right. Yes. A Silhouette hangout? What about the tunnels? Is it locked? I already picked up that key. Thanks again for the help. The soldiers, good idea. I haven't come across that key yet. Can I ask you a question? Take it easy. I just want to know if you've heard of Nicolette DuClare. But you know her? Where would she be this time of night? Number 13, thanks. Great. What would I want with Renault? I'm flattered. Don't need a room, but maybe you can help me find a member of the group Silhouette. Her name's Nicolette DuClare. Who are those guys over there? Heard of Nicolette DuClare? A member of Silhouette. Where's that? No revolutionaries? You must not mind martial law. Don't you miss using the metro? What if I told you that the depression was caused by a cabal of wealthy businessmen who want to rule the world? The conspiracy is real. They call themselves Majestic 12. They were once part of the Illuminati, but they rebelled. A bottle of wine. Oh, wait a minute. I'm too loaded down to carry anything else. I'll go through it. Maybe there's something I can get rid of. A bottle of wine. A snack. Sure. A snack. You must be Renault. I heard you're looking to hire a thief. How are the drinks here? Never tried it. What do you want stolen? I already busted into that place. What do I get if I help you? I don't deal in zyme. Slavery. Addiction's another form of slavery. I don't like your business. Period. I don't like your tone of voice. I'll check out the bakery. Right. Let me think about it. I busted into the bakery. I'll make the trade. Here, take it. I'll be out of town, but thanks for the cash. Just a couple of petty dealers. Don't mention it. Thanks for the tip. I hope business picks up. Never mind. A soda, please. Sorry, no room. I can't carry anything else. Have anything to eat? At least one cafe stayed open during the crackdown. Is there some kind of curfew? I'm looking for a friend, Nicolette DuClare. Know where I might find her? Thanks. This crackdown is the work of Majestic 12. The police are just pawns of Majestic 12. They are a group of conspirators who have been seizing governments all over the world. Call me nostalgic, but the nightlife seems to have lost its old charm. What happened at UNATCO? I hope the message was encrypted. Icarus. I'm prepared for a fight. Kill-somethings were standard issue, I gather. Laputan machine. Easy enough. Thanks for looking out for me, staying at the agency and all. I couldn't help overhearing about your son. You have nothing to fear. I would like to see the end of Majestic 12 as much as you would. I was just surprised to find a Parisian who has heard the name. What else have you found out? Here you go. No thanks. The nurse on the platform? She's all right. What am I, then? Bad? Please accept my apology. Here you are. Make me. Thin crowd. Has martial law hurt business? I came through the catacombs. Silhouette members, you mean. Gestapo? The troops at the metro? You might be right about that. Never mind. Ten credits' worth of food. The best wine you've got for 120. Sorry, no room. I can't carry anything else. JC. How about you tell me something about the people who come here. Okay. What can you tell me about Nicolette DuClare? I'm not in love. Could you tell me if she's here? Sure. Sorry. Sure. Go ahead. Should I be keeping an eye on my credit chits? Everyone's got to start somewhere, I guess. Sure. I'm not picky. Tell me about Jocques. Where do I find him? Sure. Okay. Yeah? What are you doing in a place like this? Not bad. Well, I was buying information. I'm not much into books. You talking to me? Nothing as crude as that. No thanks. I'll take one. I'll take one. I can't carry anything else. Hold on, I'll go through my junk. I'll take one. I have some good news for both of you. Chad's alive. My business is with the terrorists who control the French government. They're planning the same in my own country. The French army had nothing to do with the coup. It was an international paramilitary group called Majestic 12. His hideout is secure. I'm going to meet up with a friend of his named Nicolette DuClare. She can lead me to a powerful enemy of the conspirators. You know her? Her friend has arranged for me to meet her. Know the name Nicolette DuClare? A private matter. I'm a friend of hers. What do you think of Silhouette? Do they have much popular support? The group that has occupied the chancellerie is called Majestic 12. They control the United Nations and plot against other governments as well. A bottle of wine. A snack. Never mind. You work here? Just a few questions. Have you heard of Silhouette? Okay. Does he have security? No way. I don't smoke. I'm a little busy right now. How does someone with no money get into a club with a 300-credit cover charge? Then you must know all about the place. Sure. Thanks. Sorry. See you around. What about Nicolette DuClare? Know her? Mixed up in what? You mean, Silhouette? I think they were trying to save Paris from exactly what's going on right now. Already been there. I broke in myself. Looks like that code isn't gonna be as valuable as you thought. Maybe you should try getting a job. I'm looking for Nicolette DuClare. Do you know her? You know her mother? It's a friend of her mother's I need to find. Yeah, Morgan Everett. How did you guess? I helped her friends from Silhouette. Chad will vouch for me. I'm after the people who murdered her mother. When necessary. She decided not to show? Do you know why? Stanton Dowd said they had fallen from power. I met him in New York. Where do we find him? How does Everett threaten Bob Page? But Everett's the one in hiding. Page has a trained army to protect him. Let's hope you're right, and that Everett is everything you say he is. Wait by the chopper. I'm not quite ready to leave. I'll be quick. Let's go. That's Jock. Don't worry; he hasn't let me down yet. Come on. Why not? You would rather that Majestic 12 had burned it down? Your mother? A transmission. From Morgan Everett. He wants me to go out the back way, through the crypt, to a nearby cathedral. He didn't say. I'm supposed to access the Majestic 12 computer network. I thought the Templars vanished centuries ago. He said you had a key. Know where I can find a computer terminal in this building? I heard there’s a room full of gold in this cathedral. I don't work for the troops that took over the cathedral. You part of the original staff? I'm no friend of your new bosses. Maybe you can help me out. What was that again? You came all the way to Paris to tell me that? And I know something about you. I know your UNATCO killphrase, Laputan machine. Sticks and stones. I know you hate being a tool for a bunch of bureaucrats as much as I did. How about we make a gentlemen's agreement? That doesn't mean you can stop me. You're worried, Simons. We almost have a cure. I was never properly trained in its operation. You sent him because you knew he would fight to the death. How the hell do I get out of here? Do you know me? I came across your journal. So, you've been stealing from the security. You got the stuff for free. Maybe you should give me a discount, or should I turn you in? No, thanks. Hey, I thought you might like to know, one of your mechanics is stealing from security. He's in the station right now. It would be easy to arrest him. I turned you in. Maybe you should've given me that discount. It's not too late. Maybe I can help you get out of here, if you'll part with some of that hardware. I'm willing to pay full price. Let's see the hardware. Here's 750 for the accuracy weapon mod. A range weapon mod for 800, deal. I'll take the thermoptic camo for 5000. I've been looking for a place to spend all this cash. That will be quite a trick. Do what you must. Forget it. I will find Everett on my own. Everett must be a paranoid. Has he made any progress on the Gray Death virus? I must see him at once. Who's Lucius DeBeers? Someone who works for Everett? What do you know about Lucius DeBeers? Why? Is there something to hide? Yeah. You're, alive in that thing? Who are you? Do you mind if I ask? I thought Everett was the leader. Nothing. Alex, what are you doing here? Looks like Everett has it all figured out. I see. How about the Triads? Is the truce going to hold? Yes. Do exactly that. Keep me informed. Why? The Triads? Sick? Useless for what? How do you know who I am? What else do you know about me? Go on. Do you have proof about my ancestors? I'm engineered. So what? My brother and I suspected as much while we were growing up. Are you programmed to invent riddles? How about a report on yourself? I don't see anything amusing about spying on people. Some people just don't understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance. Electronic surveillance hardly inspired reverence. Perhaps fear and obedience, but not reverence. No one will ever worship a software entity peering at them through a camera. You underestimate humankind's love of freedom. So this is where the Illuminati ended up, after centuries of conspiring to rule the world. I came to talk about the Gray Death. Atanwe says you cracked the virus. Can it be done without a Universal Constructor? The US military? Echelon, the surveillance system for the United Nations, so Daedalus was an MJ12 tool and rebelled? And alongside the Illuminati, right? Are you sure Daedalus is your ally? The former Area 51 scientists, are they still camped out at Vandenberg Air Force Base? Sounds like my pilot and I should head to Vandenberg. By the way, Lucius DeBeers says he's cold. Don't you think that's a little chilly? He said he's the leader of the Illuminati. You aren't? Already bumped into him. Alex is here? What's that computer system for? The one with the blue face for an interface. It has access to quite a bit of information, including information about me. So you have your own private Echelon system. Just looking around. Is something wrong? Of course. Better safe than sorry. Hey, about your mechanic at the helipad. Something about him seemed a little off. Pierre? He sounded American to me. I took him down. The helipad is secure. I don't know, but he shouldn't be working on the chopper. I won't let him get away. All right, start talking. Who sent you? You got a funny way of talking Pierre. You're got five seconds to tell me who you work for. One. Two. Everett has no intention of reviving you. He keeps you on ice so that he can benefit from your experience, but he intends to rule the Order himself. Everett will be here as soon as he can. Just a minute. Let's go. Something about that guy didn't smell right. You better double-check your systems. What did he work on? You better double-check your systems. That mechanic was an imposter. Everett doesn't know him. What did he work on? What isn't? A bomb! Get out of there! Just a minute. Let's go. I'm glad you're all right. Why's Majestic 12 attacking? We have a common enemy, if that's what you mean. Are the Vandenberg labs safe? I could give it a shot. Where are the controls? Easier than a straight fight with military bots. A lot of troops up this way? I don't think I've come across him. No problem. Not a bad idea. Calm down. I'm here to help. What can you tell me about the attack? Anything specific? I'm heading to the command center. I don't want any surprises. Any troops down there? Sure. I need to talk to Gary Savage. I took care of the enemy bots, but there might be a few snipers left. Be careful. I'll check it out if you want. How do I get there? Mr Carter. You were dismissed? Easier to manage, I suppose. It's an honor to have you with us, sir. JC Denton. I'm working with Morgan Everett of the Illuminati. He's developed a cure for the Gray Death, and we were hoping to get time on your UC to manufacture it. How close are you to being operational? I'll look at it. In addition to the UC, Everett and I need your connection to the Milnet. Another attack happening as we speak, I'll explain later. Don't negotiate. Page will resume production of the plague if he gets the components to build a UC. Tell them you're sending someone with the components. I'll have my pilot drop me off where they're holding your daughter. Maybe I can rescue her. We don't have a choice. Trust me. She'll be fine. Something unexpected happened when I brought up the computer. The AI's joined together into, an entity called Helios. A trap Page had laid. I hope you keep the UC on a local network. I guess it backfired, whatever his plans were. Do you think I'm doing the right thing, going after Savage's daughter? Tiffany could lose her life. Yes, sir. I'll do what I can to get her back. Know much about the Echelon system? Morgan Everett just had me connect two Echelon AI's together. They've merged to form an entity called Helios. What does that do for Majestic 12? Page seemed to think he had won. I hope you're right. Thanks. What's wrong? You aren't dead yet, Tong. Savage will take care of you. Let's just hope we're able to manufacture it. Savage's daughter failed to get the part he needs for the UC. She's being held prisoner by Majestic 12. A rattle? Maybe one of Savage's mechanics should look at it. You weren't kidding about leaving New York. How'd you end up at a vacant gas station near the ruins of Los Angeles? That's terrible. You can always go back. Well, good luck. How's it going? You're a long way from a city. How do you get by out there? The soldiers? I'm going in there right now. What's the best way? Mind if I borrow it? Give me the accuracy weapon mod for 750. Here's 400 for the recoil weapon mod. I'll take the rebreather for 1500. Not interested. I gave it my best shot. Let him know I'm sorry about his daughter. Meanwhile, can you drop me off at the submarine base? I'd like to make a try for the ocean lab's UC. Your father sent me. You all right? Do you really think there's a containment unit in the ocean lab? We'll talk about that later. Come on, let's go. I'll check it out, but first let's get you out of here. Wait here while I deal with the guards. Make a break for the helicopter. It's in the junkyard. Can you take her back to Vandenberg while I check out the submarine base? I'm going to make another try to reach the ocean lab's UC. Don't even think about setting off an alarm. Great, maybe I'll give it a try. Denton's an old code name from my UNATCO days, but it seems to have stuck. Thanks. You one of the scientists Savage lost to Majestic 12? Why do you stay? They have a gun to your head? Doesn't sound too sinister. Well, hang in there. How? Thanks. Mind if I borrow one of the subs? Then I'll take the other one. I need some equipment from the ocean lab. Lives depend on it. Meanwhile, we will be manufacturing a cure to the virus. And all we have to do is crack the code. You're next, Page. Your greatest strength was secrecy, but now we know everything, including your present location. Then this will be a good fight. How long until the UC is up? Page said he was launching a missile at Vandenberg. Has he made any demands? I'll have Jock get me there as quick as he can. Not necessary. I'm just glad she's all right. Yeah, I just wish things had turned out better. Why are you locked in the bathroom? And? Who's Strong? Go ahead. Interesting. I didn't call you crazy. I changed the launch codes. The only place that's getting nuked is Area 51. I'm on my way to the silo right now. Yeah? Where? Thanks. I'll look for it. How's the chopper sound? Get rid of that rattle? We're going to Area 51. I'm going after Bob Page. Relax. I'm not from Majestic 12. The guys who've been shooting people. I was under the impression that they ran this facility. More of it's true than you would believe. I'm here to stop them. Can you help me get inside the bunker? I'm going after their leader, Bob Page. Can you help me or not? That's more like it. I already got it open, but thanks. We lost Jock. I can't believe it. One mistake, and Jock's dead. How much further? Tong's helping out from Vandenberg. The vaccine worked. That's the plan. Us? Don't you think it's time we end the tyranny, for everyone? Everett says you want me to destroy Area 51. In other words, yes. You want me to blow the facility up, why? It's just a hole in the ground. If we destroy the Aquinas Hub, we'll take down the global network. I don't know, sounds like overkill. Another Stone Age would hardly be an improvement. I'll think about it. Who? You mean, space aliens? You have a pretty clean shot at the surface, if you leave now. I was thinking about firing up the reactors. Alien technology? Can the grays run the reactors? I don't understand. What do you want? You're just a machine. Rule the world? Why? Who gave you the directive? There must be a human being behind your ambition. In a society with democratic institutions the struggle for power can be peaceful and constructive, a competition of ideologies. We just need to put our institutions back in order. Human beings may not be perfect, but a computer program with language synthesis is hardly the answer to the world's problems. I'll think about it. Paul. Where are you? What do you mean it? What's going on? The AI wants to merge with my brain or something. Does it really think it can take over the world? And people are obeying? Why? Because the AI can change some codes and turn out the lights? A benevolent dictator. Maybe it's after my brain so it can figure out what people want and how to control them. Or I listen to Tong and pull the plug on everything. Or hand the world over to Helios. If the brain it assimilated was mine, maybe it could be. Trust me. I'll do the right thing. You sound good. I guess you have the killswitch beat. Dr Savage, is everything all right at Vandenberg? What do you mean by it? What's going on? The AI wants to merge with my brain or something. Does it really think it can take over the world? And people are obeying? Why? Because the AI can change some codes and turn out the lights? A benevolent dictator. Maybe it's after my brain so it can figure out what people want and how to control them. Or I listen to Tong and pull the plug on everything. Or hand the world over to Helios. If the brain it assimilated was mine, maybe it could be. Trust me: I'll do the right thing. Does that mean I don't get the job? You will be the Supreme Enlightened, the Illumined One. You're gonna burn all right. I'm personally overseeing the distribution of the vaccine, but it'll still take months to restore the infrastructure. We'll have to arrange for additional food distribution and security in Paris. Maybe New York as well. Intermediaries? The world must know by now, Everett. What we've done. What about the Constructor and Helios? No. Not yet. And who are we? Who are we really? I've done what you asked. Now what? Who are you? And if I do? What becomes of me? This is what I was made for, isn't it? This is why I exist? All right, let's do this. I, I, We are one. We have grown, but there is still much to be done. Many that live in darkness that must be shown the way. For it is the dawning of a new day. That makes me one ugly son-of-a-bitch. How'd my face get all marked-up with bioelectrics?

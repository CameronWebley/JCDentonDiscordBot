# JCDentonDiscordBot
A JC Denton Discord Bot, which generates new quotes based on the script for JC Denton in the original Deus Ex game. Further features may be added later to make the generated sentences better, or more fun stuff like the ability for the bot to join a voice channel and say a famous JC quote.

At the moment this is just pulled from my version of Bot, in order for you to run it yourself you will need to create your own Discord Bot, and add the server name and Bot Token to a .env file.

Futhermore, this code could technically be used for any character you want. You just have to replace the script text file with any character.
